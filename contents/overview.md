* There are many **graph databases** such as Neo4j, Oracle PGX, Amazon Neptune, etc.
* Different graph databases use different **property graph models and formats**
* We define the property graph (PG) data model and its serialization (**PG** and **JSON-PG**)
* We also provide several **converters** into various other related data formats
